Consolidation Plus Tuple Out
The game "Tuple Out" is a game where players will take turns rolling three six-sided dice. The goal of the game is to recieve the highest total score of the dice added together. If a player rolls two of the same number, those dice values are "fixed", but any remaining values you can reroll. But if you roll three of the same number, you "tuple out" and recieve a score of zero for that turn. The game proceeds for five turns, and the player with the highest score wins.

1. You start by entering the number of players. 
2. Each player will then take their turn by rolling the dice, and it will tell you what your fixed dice are or if you have tupled out. 
3. You can then decide if you want to reroll any dice that are not fixed, or accept the score you have recieved. When you choose to stop, that number will be added to your total score. 
4. After each player takes five turns the game will end. Each player's total score is added up and the highest score is declared the winner. 
5. After the game the results will be written to game_results.txt. This includes the duration of the game play as well.
